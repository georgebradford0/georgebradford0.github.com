# Sample Article

This is a sample blog article with markdown and LaTeX support[^1].

## Mathematics

You can write inline math like $E = mc^2$ or display math:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

This integral is particularly important in probability theory[^2].

## Code

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## More Math

The quadratic formula[^3] is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code`.

## Blockquotes

The annotations you see on the right are footnotes[^4] that appear at the same vertical position as their references.

[^1]: Footnotes appear on the right side of the page, aligned with where they're referenced in the text.
[^2]: The Gaussian integral is fundamental to the normal distribution in statistics.
[^3]: This formula was known to ancient mathematicians but was first stated in its modern form by European mathematicians in the 16th century.
[^4]: This margin note system is inspired by Edward Tufte's design principles for displaying annotations.
